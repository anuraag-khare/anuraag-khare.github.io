Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Anuraag Khare, a Software Engineer passionate about building scalable backend systems and exploring the exciting frontiers of Generative AI.

## Why Start a Blog?

After years of consuming incredible content from the developer community, I've decided it's time to give back. This blog will be my platform to:

- **Share Technical Deep-Dives**: Breaking down complex backend architectures, system design patterns, and GenAI implementations
- **Document My Learning Journey**: From RAG pipelines to multi-agent systems, I'll share what I learn along the way
- **Discuss Industry Trends**: My thoughts on where software engineering is heading

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about topics close to my daily work and interests:

### Backend Engineering
From building scalable APIs with FastAPI to optimizing database queries in PostgreSQL, I'll share practical insights from real-world projects.

### Generative AI
As someone who's built RAG-based automation and multi-agent systems, I have a lot to share about the practical side of GenAI in production.

### Cloud & Infrastructure
My experiences with GCP, AWS, Kubernetes, and everything in between.

## A Bit About Me

Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer at HashedIn by Deloitte, where I'm building backend systems and engineering multi-agent AI solutions. Before this, I was a Founding Engineer at Kuttl, where I built GenAI-powered invoice processing systems from scratch.

```python
# My philosophy in code
def build_software():
    while True:
        learn_something_new()
        build_something_useful()
        share_with_community()
```
